# Counter-Strike-Global-Offensive
In this project, I have used the CS:GO dataset prepared using the prevoius players data containing diffferent columns as different parameters from the game and developed a model that can predict weather a person can win or loose. I have used preprocessing techniques such as LabelEncoder and StandardScaler for converting categorical data to numerical and standardisation of data.I have used different ML models for identifying which model will give the best accuracy. I have also used LDA(Linear Discriminant Analysis) for dimensionality reduction in non-seperable data, because the dataset is having many columns. And I have used 20 important columns for this prediction purpose. Here I have used metrics such as confusion matrix and accuracy score.
